    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/3 cup warm water (35-40ºC to be exact)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
      <li>1 (6 grams) packet instant yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
      <li>3 3/4 cup flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped rosemary (plus more)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup roasted garlic, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>flaked sea salt (for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add the warm water, sugar, and yeast to a 2-cup measuring cup. Give it a
        stir and allow the yeast to bloom for 15 minutes. You'll see the yeast
        is foamy and bubbly near the end of the 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add the flour, salt, 1/4 cup of olive oil, chopped rosemary,
        and roasted garlic to the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook
        attachment, turn the mixer on briefly to allow the ingredients to mix
        together. Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture with the mixer
        running on low. Increase the speed to medium and let the mixer run for
        4-5 minutes. Stop and scrape the dough if all the flour doesn't
        incorporate fully. After 5 minutes, if the dough seems too sticky, use
        an additional 1-2 tablespoon of flour and form it into a ball using your
        hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough into a large bowl that has been greased. Rub a dime
        size of olive oil on the surface of the dough and cover with a piece of
        plastic wrap. Allow it to rest in a warm place for 1-1 1/2 hours or
        until it's nearly doubled in size. I usually do this in my dryer
      </li>
      <li>
        Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400ºF.
        Using half of the remaining olive oil (2 tbsp), grease the bottom of a
        9x13 dish. Remove the plastic wrap, and dump the dough into the prepared
        dish. Gently, using your fingers, push the dough out so that it fits the
        pan. Cover the dough with the plastic wrap and let sit for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil onto the dough. Using
        your fingers poke holes in the surface of the dough (seriously, poke all
        the way to the pan!) Sprinkle with additional rosemary, if desired and
        flaked sea salt. Bake the bread for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown
        on top and cooked all the way through. Remove from the oven, drizzle or
        brush with a little bit more olive oil and let cool for a few minutes
        before slicing and serving!
